Exploratory factor analysis (EFA)  aims at  identifying factors (underlying dimensions or structures ) that explain the correlations among a set of variables. 

A basic hypothesis of EFA is that there are M common ‘factors to be discovered in the dataset

The goal of EFA  is to find the smallest number of common factors that will account for the correlations
